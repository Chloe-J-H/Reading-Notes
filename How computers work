What is computer?
A computer a electronic device that allows the manipulation of information.

In order to manipulate information, the device (computer) should have four components:
1. Input (the information to be manipulated)
2. Storage (store the information in memory as data)
3. Processing (takes the data from memory, manipulates it via algorithm, then returns to the memory) 
4. Output (the results - eg games)

How do Computers Work? Binary & Data

Computers consists of electrical wires and circuit.
How do you store or represent information using electricity
Single wire may be in either a on/off state called a bit
Bit is the smallest piece of information that a computer can store
Information is represented as the binary number system
Binary system is represented in only two digits - 0 and 1

Images - made up of pixels and may be represented by numbers 
Sounds - represented graphically as a waveform. Any point on the waveform may be represented as a number.
         An increase in the bit number is an increase in sound quality

How do computers work? Circuits & Logic
Circuits modify and process information that's represented by binary system.
This means if the information 0 is input then the circuit changes it to 1 and vise versa 

How do computers work? Memory, CPU, Input & Output
Input Devices - convert information and converts it into binary information
Eg sensor on a car or keyboard
The keyboard converts the information to a number.
The CPU then calcuates how to represent the information and stores in pixels
The pixel is then sent in binary numbersignals to the screen, output device
