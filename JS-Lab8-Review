Check the condition.
If the rteurn is true then the code block will run.
It will continue to run until the condition is false

Three common types of loops:

1. For :
    Uses a counter as a condition 
    runs for a specific number of times
2. While - may run for an infinite number of times as long as the condition is true
3.Do While - runs the condition in the curly brace once even if the condition is false

An example:

for (var 1=0; 1<10; i++){
    document.write(i);
}
