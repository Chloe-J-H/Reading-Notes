SCRIPT (Pages 1-24)

A series of instructions that a computer follows to achieve a goal

Writing a script constitutes the following:
1. Defining the goal (Clearly and concisely define on what you intend to achieve)
2. Designing the script (Create steps or series of tasks on how you would achieve the goal)
3. Then code each step (Each step should be written in a programming language that teh computer understands)

EXPRESSIONS (Pages 74)

An expression is a syntatic entity in a programming lanuage that may be evlauted to determine its value (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)#cite_note-1)

Two types of expression:

1. Assigns a value to a variable

An example:

var color = 'beige';

2. Assigns two or more values to return a variable

An example:

var area = 3 * 2;
the area is now 6

OPERATORS (Pages 75-79)

 According to https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z788jty/revision/5, an operator is a character or characters that determine the action that is to be performed or considered.

Types of Operators:

1. Assignment Operators : Assigns a value to a variable
2.Arithmetic Operators: Perfoms basic mathematical equations
3. String Operators: combines two strings (text)
4. Comparison Operators: Compares two values and retruns a boolean (true/false)
5.Logical Operators: Combine expressions and return a boolean

FUNCTION (Pages 88-94)

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).(Page 88, JavaScript & Query)

Main Points

- If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, it should be given a name
- When you ask the program to perform the task it is known as *calling* the function
- The steps that the function is to perform is called a code block
- Code block is one or more statments contained within curly braces (a semicolon is not required at the end of the statement)
-  Function needs information to perform a task, this is known as parameters
- The output or result of the function is called a return value
- 

Summary: To create a function, you give the task a name, write the statements 
          needed to achieve the task inside the curly braces.
          This is known as a function declaration


Example:

function sayHello() {
    document.write('Hello');
}

- function - function declaration
- sayHello() - name (or also known as identifier)
{document.write('Hello!')} - statement that performs the task or code block
- to call the function you then write the function name:
sayHello();
