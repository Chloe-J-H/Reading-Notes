<h1>Javascript Review</h1>
<h3>SCRIPT (Pages 1-24)</h3>

<br> Series of instructions that a computer follows to achieve a goal</br>

<br>Writing a script constitutes the following:</br>
<br>1. Defining the goal (Clearly and concisely define on what you intend to achieve)</br>
<br>2. Designing the script (Create steps or series of tasks on how you would achieve the goal)</br>
<br>3. Then code each step (Each step should be written in a programming language that teh computer understands)</br>

<h3>EXPRESSIONS (Pages 74)</h3>

<br>An expression is a syntatic entity in a programming lanuage that may be evlauted to determine its value (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)#cite_note-1)</br>

<br>Two types of expression:</br>

<br>1. Assigns a value to a variable</br>

<br>An example:</br>

<br>var color = 'beige';</br>

<br>2. Assigns two or more values to return a variable</br>

<br>An example:</br>

<br>var area = 3 * 2;</br>
<br>the area is now 6</br>

<h3>OPERATORS (Pages 75-79)</h3>

  <br>According to https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z788jty/revision/5, an operator is a character or characters that determine the action that is to be performed or considered.</br>

  <br>Types of Operators:</br>

  <br>1. Assignment Operators : Assigns a value to a variable</br>
  <br>2.Arithmetic Operators: Perfoms basic mathematical equations</br>
  <br>3. String Operators: combines two strings (text)</br>
  <br>4. Comparison Operators: Compares two values and retruns a boolean (true/false)</br>
  <br>5.Logical Operators: Combine expressions and return a boolean</br>

<h3>FUNCTION (Pages 88-94)</h3>

  <br>Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a</br>
  <br>specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can</br>
  <br>reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).(Page 88, JavaScript & Query)</br>

<h4>Main Points</h4>

<br>- If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, it should be given a name</br>
<br>- When you ask the program to perform the task it is known as *calling* the function</br>
<br>- The steps that the function is to perform is called a code block</br>
<br>- Code block is one or more statments contained within curly braces (a semicolon is not required at the end of the statement)</br>
<br>-  Function needs information to perform a task, this is known as parameters</br>
<br>- The output or result of the function is called a return value</br>


<br>Summary: To create a function, you give the task a name, write the statements 
          needed to achieve the task inside the curly braces.
          This is known as a function declaration</br>


          <br>Example:</br>

          <br>function sayHello() {</br>
            <br> document.write('Hello');</br>
            <br>}</br>

            <br>- function - function declaration</br>
<br>- sayHello() - name (or also known as identifier)</br>
<br>{document.write('Hello!')} - statement that performs the task or code block</br>
<br>- to call the function you then write the function name:</br>
<br>sayHello();</br>
