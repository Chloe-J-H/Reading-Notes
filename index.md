## Syntax Guide

Below is a list of 

### Header 
If you want to add a header to your page add a hastag (#).

#### Example

# This is an <h1> tag (add 1 hastag))
## This is an <h2> tag (add 2 hash
###### This is an <h6> tag	Header (add 6 hashtags)
  
### Emphasis 

Add a asterisk or underscore to emphasize your words.
Italics require one asterisk/underscore whilst bolding your text would require two.

#### Example 

 * *This text will be italic* *
_ _This will also be italic_ _

** **This text will be bold** **
__ __This will also be bold__ __

_You **can** combine them_	

### Unordered Lists

Add an asterisk before the item to create an unordered list

#### Example

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
  
### Ordered Lists

Add the numeral before the item to create an ordered list

#### Example

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b	

### Block Quotes

To create a blockquote add an (>) before the quote.

#### Example

As Kanye West said:

>  > We're living the future so
>  > the present is our past.	Block quotes

### Images

Add images to your website by writing the link in the below format:

![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)	

#### Example 

Uitlizing an image from placeholder.com, you would write the below:
 
 ![placeholder] ( https://via.placeholder.com/150 )
 
 which would generate :
 
![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

### Links

If you would like to add link to another website, then you would write the following:

1.https://github.com 
2.[GitHub](http://github.com)

If you forget to add the alt, that the url will be converted to a clickable link automatically.

### Inline Code

Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a file by enclosing with the code with backticks.

#### Example

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.	

### Strikethrough

If you want to imply a made a mistake or then add a strikethrough with ~.

#### Eaxmple

~~this~~	(~~ this ~~ )

### Emoji

Spice up your website with an emoji.
